== Hearts of Iron: Fatherland (v1.01) == <br>  A scenario loosely based on the best selling alternative history noval 'Fatherland' by Robert Harris, set in roughly 1946; According to the novel's version of history, the German <br>    armies on the Eastern Front are stopped at the gates of Moscow at the end of 1941, as in our history. Defeated in battle but not demoralized, they launch a second major offensive<br>   into the Caucasus in 1942, cutting the flow of oil to the Red Army; although Red army was able to inflict massive casulties on Germans, they are unable to destroy German garrison <br>  in Stalingrad; With its armies immobilised, Russians had to abandon Leningrad and Moscow, and fight Germans west of Urals near newly established industrial center; Unable to drive the <br>  Germans out of Russia, Stalin sued for peace in 1943; Urged by his Gernerals, Hitler relunctantly agreed. Germany was thus able to transfer many divisions from Eastern front to Western <br>  Europe and Africa; Having Russia knocked out of War, Western Allies saw little hope of defeating Germany, decided to go after Japan instead; a ceasefire agreement was signed in May 44 <br>  In the Pacific, IJA was steadily pushed back to home island by end of 1944; never missing an opportunity, Stalin launched a massive assault on Manchuria, capturing Northern China and <br>  Korea, handed them over under Mao's communists control after dismantling Japanese factories, enabling Mao to win the civil war; with a failed Manhattan project, U.S landed in Southern<br>  Japan in winter 45; to minimize casulties, American invited Russians to attack Japan from North; Japan surrendered after suffering almost a third of its population as casulties. With a  <br>  defeated Japan, and a ceasefire with Germany, the alliance with Russia officially ended in 1946, a three front cold war was thus ensured.....<br>===    Capitals/in order of turn order === <br>   Russia - Novo-brisk------------ Germany - Eastern Germany <br>  China - Western China--------USA - Northeastern United States <br> NaziEuropeanUnion - Italy-------Britain - Eastern Canada <br>   === NEW Unit definitions === <br>Units have been revised to bring better balance most importantly, national advantage!!!  <br>   fighter:    3, 4, 9  <br>   jetfighter/MiG9:    4,5,4,12 (Germany, Russia)<br>  P51Mustang  4/4/4/12 (u.S.  anti sub)    Lancaster heavy bomber:     5, 2, 16 (special: SBR, UK only)<br>  tactical bomber 5/1/14 (can not do strategic bombing raid)<br>  B25 medium bomber:3x2/3/7/20 (heavy duty bomber, takes heavy damage, 2 hits)<br>    B29 SuperFortress:    4x2,2,8, 28 (heavy bomber with devastating range 8, U.S.A. only)<br>  B36_peaceMaker    5x2/2/10/35   transport 0/0/7 <br>  destroyer 2/2/8  <br>  submarine 2/2/7 <br>  battleship 4/4/24 <br>  carrier 1/2/18  <br>   silentHunter class submarine:    3, 1, 9 (special: move on 3)<br>   Special task destroyer:  2, 2, 9 (special: moves on 3, Japan only)<br> escortcarrier: 1, 1, 10 (special: 2 fighters capacity, can not carrier heavy bomber, UK only)<br> Fleet carrier:    2, 3, 25 (special: 5 fighters/3 fighter,1 bomber/B29 may land on a carrier, American only)<br>  Bismarck class battleship: 5, 4, 26 (German heavy warship, can transport)<br> King_George_class_battleship 4/5/28 (Royal navy flag ship, transport, anti-sub)    naval mine: 0, 1, 2.5 (special: anit naval)<br>   Katyusha mobile rocket launcher:    2, 1, 4 (cheap Russian mobile artillery)<br>  lightarmour: 2, 2, 4 (bliz,available all countries except China)<br>  armour 3/3/6 (bliz, America, Britain, Germany, Russia only) <br> T34 medium tank 3/3/5 (with economy of mass scale, T34 cost 4 each, but needs to be produced in mass, cost 40 for 10)<br> halftrack:    1, 2, 4 (highly mobile armour, bliz, 3 move, Germany) <br>   Tiger:    4, 3, 10 (famous German heavy tank, bliz, 2 hits, very high transport cost) <br> Tiger2:    5, 5, 12 (the ultimate Germany heavy tank, takes 2 hits, artillery, can not be transported and only moves 1 due to heavy weight) <br> IS3: 5/4/12    infantry 1/2/3 sniper: 1, 5, 6 (elite infantry, Germany and Russia);<br> commando: 3, 3, 6 (elite raiding units, o transport cost, UK)<br> PantherGrenadier: 2, 3, 5 (highly mobile elite infantry, low transport cost, bliz, artillery supportable, Germany)<br> sniper 1/5/6 <br> Bunker: 0, 2, 3 (defence structure, Germany only)<br> conscript: 0, 1, 1 (china)<br> GulagConscript 1/2/2 (Russia, no artillery support) mobile factory: (special: well, it's mobile, availble only to Communists)<br>
